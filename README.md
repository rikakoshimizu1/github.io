# Timon Lepidus (Ocellated Lizard) Scale Pattern Simulation

## Overview
This project uses cellular automata to simulate the dynamic skin scale patterns of the *Timon lepidus* (ocellated lizard). By varying key parameters, the simulation captures how the lizard's scale patterns evolve from juvenile to adult stages. Through local cell interactions, the model produces emergent global patterns that closely resemble those found in nature, offering a computational perspective on biological pattern formation. 

## Background
The formation of natural patterns such as those on seashells, snowflakes, or animal coats, has long fascinated both biologists and mathematicians. Cellular automata is a mathematical modeling technique that uses grids of discrete cells updated by local rules. This method provides a powerful framework for studying how complex patterns emerge. This project applies cellular automata to replicate the striking scale arrangements observed in *Timon lepidus*, a species known for its mosaic-like skin patterns. By simulating the rules that govern cell behavior and interaction, the model demonstrates how biologically realistic structures can form through simple, local interactions. This work builds on research in computational biology and contributes to the broader understanding of natural pattern formation. 

## Features
 - **Grid-based cellular automata simulation** representing individual scale cells.
 - Rule set designed to mimic biological growth and pigmentation processes.
 - Visualization of evolving patterns over simulation time steps.
 - Adjustable parameters to explore different pattern outcomes.
 - Exportable images and data for further analysis.

## Key Aspects
 - Implementation of custom transition rules inspired by lizard scale growth.
 - Emphasis on local interaction leading to emergent complex patterns.
 - Integration of biological accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Challenges
 - Defining a rule set that produce biologically realistic patterns while remaining computationally simple.
 - Managing performance issues related to memory and processing time, especially on larger grids.
 - Ensuring consistent, stable pattern evolution without the patterns getting stuck or showing unwanted glitches. 
 - Comparing simulated results to biological data and photographs of *Timon lepidus* to assess accuracy and improve the model.
